Git Diffrence comanads:comparing the files in version control system.
To compaire the file contens between working directory bitween staging area between staging area between local Repository between Remote Repository using git differnce command. 

workin directory--->staging area--->local Repository--->Remote Repository.

 1:index.txt:create one file add singel line code.
 	-add this singel line code into staging area.
	like	animal
 2:to add some code of line in same line.
	this is a updated code. or new code is added.
	like animal Birds

Requirements 1: To see difference in file content between Working Directory and Staging Area.

Explainations :

The output from the git diff command is showing the changes made to a file called index.txt between two versions (before and after the change).

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

The line -animal (with a minus sign) indicates that this is the content of the file before the change.
The line +animal (with a plus sign) shows that the word "animal" is still present after the change, meaning it hasn't been modified.
The new line +Birds (with a plus sign) is added to the file. This is the new content introduced.
\ No newline at end of file means that, in both versions, the file doesn't have an empty line at the very end.
In summary, the file originally had the word "animal" on one line, and now it has "animal" and "Birds" on two lines.



Requirment 2:To see the diffrence between in file between Working directory and Local Repository/last Commit. 
Last commit always referred using HEAD key word it refered to the local repository.

git diff HEAD index.txt =>This command represent diffrence between HEAD means Local repository or last commited code file.

diff --git a/index.txt b/index.txt
index 4734a6a..c3f6d12 100644
--- a/index.txt
+++ b/index.txt
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
-animal
\ No newline at end of file
+animal
+Birds
+Fishes
\ No newline at end of file


 Explainations:

This git diff HEAD index.txt command shows the difference between the current state of your index.txt file and the latest commit (referred to as HEAD).

Here's a simple explanation of the changes:

Before the change (-animal): The file originally had only the word "animal" on a single line.
After the change (+animal): The word "animal" is still present, so this line remains unchanged.
New lines added:
+Birds: The word "Birds" has been added to a new line.
+Fishes: The word "Fishes" has also been added as another new line.
No newline at end of file: This message means that, even after these additions, there is still no blank line at the very end of the file.
In summary, you added two new lines to the file—"Birds" and "Fishes"—while keeping the original "animal" line intact.


Requirement 3:To see the diffrence in file content between staged Copy and locale Repository/Last Commit.

git diff --staged HEAD index.txt : =>to compaire staging file into Locale repository.


diff --git a/index.txt b/index.txt
index 4734a6a..c3f6d12 100644
--- a/index.txt
+++ b/index.txt
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
-animal
\ No newline at end of file
+animal
+Birds
+Fishes
\ No newline at end of file

Explaination:
The git diff --staged HEAD index.txt command compares the changes that have been staged for the next commit with the latest commit (referred to as HEAD).

Here's what the output means:

Before the change (-animal): The file initially had only the word "animal" on one line.
After the change (+animal): The word "animal" is still present, unchanged.
New lines added:
+Birds: The word "Birds" has been added as a new line.
+Fishes: The word "Fishes" has been added as another new line.
No newline at end of file: This message indicates that even after the changes, there is no blank line at the end of the file.
In summary, the changes you've staged for the next commit include adding the words "Birds" and "Fishes" to the index.txt file, while keeping the original word "animal" unchanged.

Requirements 4:To see diffrence between in file content between specific Commit and Working Directory Copy.
we can do this using commit ID.(like 2c2ce443ad23ae006d9739bf5c4098598e4e2d5c )

git log --oneline =>To get the all Commit ID.

git diff de68291  index.txt

Explaination:
The git diff de68291 index.txt command compares the state of the index.txt file at the commit de68291 to the current state of the file.

Here's what the output means:

Before the change (-animal): In the commit de68291, the file only had the word "animal" on a single line.
After the change (+animal): The word "animal" is still present, so it hasn't been modified.
New lines added:
+Birds: The word "Birds" has been added to the file.
+Fishes: The word "Fishes" has been added to the file.
+trees: The word "trees" has also been added as a new line.
No newline at end of file: The message indicates that there is no blank line at the end of the file, even after the additions.
In summary, since the commit de68291, three new lines have been added to the index.txt file: "Birds", "Fishes", and "trees", while the original line "animal" remains unchanged.

Requirment 5:To see diffrence in file content between specific commit and staging area copy.


git diff --staged de68291 


$ git diff --staged de68291

Explaination:
The git diff --staged de68291 command shows the difference between the staged changes and the state of the file at the commit de68291.

Here's what the output tells us:

Before the change (-animal): In the commit de68291, the file only had one line with the word "animal."
After the change (+animal): The word "animal" is still present, so it's unchanged.
New lines added:
+Birds: The word "Birds" has been added.
+Fishes: The word "Fishes" has been added.
+trees: The word "trees" has been added as well.
No newline at end of file: This means that the file still does not have a blank line at the end, even after the new content was added.
In summary, the changes you've staged for the next commit include adding the words "Birds," "Fishes," and "trees" to the index.txt file, while the original "animal" line remains untouched. This is the difference compared to the state of the file in commit de68291.

Requirement 6:To see diffrence between two specified commit.

git diff de68291 f31baaa index.txt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git rm command in git:
how we can remove or delete the file in working director or staging area.
we have three files: 
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt

1: git ls-files:this command show you how much file added in staging area.

scenario 1:Remove files from both staging and working directory.
comman:	git rm file 1.txt
	this command remove file from working directory and staging area both.

scenario 2:Remove all files from both staging area and working directory both.
command: git rm -r .
	 remove all files from both working directory  and staging area.

scenario 3:Remove file only fron staging area not from the working directory.
command:  git rm --cached file2.txt
	  this comman remove file2 from the staging area not from working directory.

scenario 4:Remove file from working directory not from staging directory.
command:rm file3.txt
	this is a linux comman to remove file from working directory not from staging area.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git checkout commands:
we can used checkout command to discard unstaged changes in the tracked files of working directory.

what is Tracked file?
=>A tracked file in Git is a file that file atlest add to staging and local repository. are known as Tracked file.

what is Unstaged changes?
=>The file havinng changes but Those changes or not part of the staging area.means thos changes withch is not part of the staging area.called as Unstaged changes.

There are three stages:
1: Only for working diectory.
2: To discard unstaged changes(The changes which are not added to staging area)
3: In the tracked files (The files which are already added to staging area/commit).

command:git checkout -- file1.txt

command: cat file1.txt 
	 this comman for you seethe containt of file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Git reset command:
1: To remove changes from staging area.
2: To undo commits at repository level.

scenario1:To remove changes from staging area.
command: git reset index.txt
         this is a exactly aposite to git add . commans

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario2: To undo commits at repository level.
syntax:  git reset <mode> <commit ID>

Moves the HEAD to the specified commite and all remaing recent commit 
will be removed.

Mode will decied whether these changes are going to remove from staging area and working directory ot not.
Manly we use three mode:
	1: --mixed
	2: --soft
	3: --hard

In working directory and staging area toking about the files but in local repository we dont toking about the files insted of file we can say commites.

we have three commits 
like commit1  after
     commit2  after
     commit3	

but when we git log
thst time sequence of commit is like reverse
commit3 after =>this is a courrent commit
commit2 after=>this is a second one
commit1 =>this is a last one.

1: reset with --mixed Mode:
	It is the default mode.
	To descard commits in the local repository and to descard changes on staging area we should use with --mixed option.
	It will not toch working directory.

command: git reset --mixed 4a5ad43  
	Jo ID ham de rahe ahi uske ageke jo bhi commits honge wo sab remove ho jayenge. is --mixed mode mai.


2: reset with --soft Options:
	It is a exactly same as a --miexd option,but changes are available in working directory as a well as in staging area.
	It wont touch staging area and working directory.
	As changes already present in staging area, just we have to use commit to revert back.
command: git reset --soft 64dd7bc
	 when we give first commit ID the above all second and thared commit will be discard in only local repository not in staging and working directory.


3: reset with --hard Option:
	It is a exactly same as a --mixed except that changes will be removed from everyone(local repositotry, staging area and working directolry).
	It is a Imposible to revert back and hency while using hard reset we have to take special care.
command: git reset --hard 64dd7bc
	 Those file are remvoed permanently.above commited are discarede.

Diffrence between --mixed VS --soft VS --hard?
1: --mixed:
	Change will be discarded in local repo and staging area.
	It won't touch working directopy.
	Working tree won't be clean.
	But we can revert with 
		git add .
		git commit

2:--soft:
	Change will be discard only in local repository.
	It won't touch staging area and working directory.
	Working tree won't be clean.
	But we can revert with
		git commit

3: --hard:
	Change will be descared everywhere.
	Working tree won't be clean.
	No way to revert.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git branching:

* =>Representing in active branche

1: To view available branches on repository.
	git branch

2: To see current branch(on master branch).
	git status

3: Create new branche:
	git branch branch_Name
  	-after createing a new branche to check branch using 
	git branch command.

4: To switch to from one branch to another branch:
   git checkout  ==>discard unstaged changes in working directory.
	git checkout branch_name

   To check branche is switch or not use git branch command
   To see the all file which is inherited from the main/master branche is present        in created branch use below command
	 git ls-files 

Creating and switching to branch:
	git checkout -b branch_name
To check branche is created and switch or not use 
	git branch command
   To see the all file which is inherited from the main/master branche is present        in created branch use below command
	 git ls-files

NOTE:when we create new file in master and those are staged file which are not affected in other chiled branch.
when we switch on chile branch and create one new file those file are not affected
on a master banch.

After doing some changes in chile branche file those changes we will marge into the main/master branches.

All branches are the isolated means each branch is independent.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Git merge command :
-create a new project
	test
-open git bash
	right click in that project and click on open git bash

-initilize git in that project
	git init

-create some file 
	touch a.txt b.txt

-add those file into staging and commit them to local repository.
	git add a.txt; git commit -m"a.txt commited"
	git add b.txt; git commit-m"b.txt commited"

-to check commit
	git log --oneline

-create a new branch
	git branch feature

-lets check branche is created
	git branch
	but currently we are on master branch

-to switch branch
	git checkout feature

-lets check branche is switch or not
	git branch
	now currently we are on feature bramnch

-Now we are creating two file in feature branch
	touch x.txt y.txt

-add those file in staging area and commit them to local repo
	git add x.txt; git commit -m"C1F"
	git add y.txt; git commit -m"C2F"

-to check commited file
	git log --oneline
	so totally we have four commit are ther.two from the master and two for the feature.

*How we can doing merging concepts here:
-we want to merge feature branch code with master branch.
-we want to switch from feature branch to master branch first.
	git checkout master

-to check switch or not
	git branch

-to merge frature branch to master branch
	git merge feature
 we can get some output here:-
	Updating f82ac8c..4a0447e
 1:Fast-forward
 	x.txt | 0
 	y.txt | 0
 	2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 	create mode 100644 x.txt
 	create mode 100644 y.txt

-to check how much file in master branch after commit feature branch file will be added in master.
	git ls-files
	
	a.txt
	b.txt
	x.txt
	y.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2:Three way merge:

-create a new project
	Test

-initilize git to the project
	git init

-create some file in master
	touch a.txt b.txt

-add this file to staging or local repository.
	git add a.txt; git commit -m"C1M"
	git add b.txt; git commit -m"C2M"

-to check commited file
	git log --oneline

-to create a new branch
	git branche feature

-To check branch is created or not
	git branch

-to switch on feature branch
	git checkout feature

-create some files in feature branch
	touch x.txt y.txt
-lets check fule is created or not 
	git ls-files

-add those file in staging or local repository
	git add x.txt; git commit -m"C1F"
	git add y.txt; git commit -m"C2F"

-to check commited file and head of thye file is
	git log --oneline
	we can see in feature brancg last commit C2F is the HEAD.

*IMP=>
-switch to master file
	git checkout master

-see branch is changed or not
	git branch

-see the file of master branch
	git ls-files
	currently we are in two files in master.

-let me check previous commits in mastre branch
	git log --oneline
	now we will have 
	master -=> 2 commits and 2 files.
	feature => 4 commits and 4 files

-create a new commit in master branch
	touch c.txt

-lets check it's create or not
	git ls-fies
	master => 3 commits 3 files
	feature => 4 commits 4 files

-to add this newly created file in a staging area and local repository.
	git add c.txt; git commit -m"C3M"

-to check the all commits in master branch
	git log --oneline
	there are three commits are there and latest commit or HEAD is C3M 
*IMP---------------------------------------------------------------
To merge feature branch files into the master branch

-to check currently we are in master branch
	git branch
	if you are on a master branch the switch the branch using
	git checkout master 

-to mearg feature branch into master
	git merge feature
	see diffrent type of editor because its a three way commit.

-to back to bash enter 
	:wq!

-we can get the output is;
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.(three way merge is called recursive strategy)
 x.txt | 0
 y.txt | 0
 2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 x.txt
 create mode 100644 y.txt

-after commited git create selfe commit that is a head to see 
	git log --oneline

8d81c46 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'feature'(this is a new commit from the git self after merge feature branch into master branch). HEAD->master pointer aqlways point to the new created commit.
d4b5dfa C3M
e46cda0 (feature) C2F
7cbe4e4 C1F
b34f845 C2M
402fcb3 C1M


Here no create confilect beacuse we cant modify the fies we juct create a new file in master branch ater createing and adding the feature branch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolve Merge Conflicts:

-create the new project
	git Conflict

-to open that project in git bash

-To initilize git on that projets:
	git init

-To create file in mastre branch using linux comman
	vim text.txt

-let's check file is created or not:
	ls
-create one file using linux comman
	vim Test.txt

-to add some line in this file 
	type insert word and enter some line
	"This is a my first line code"

	control + c =>back from insert

	after that type
	:wq! => for back to git bash  window from the linux window.

-to see code or line of file or content of file:
	cat Test.txt

-to add file staging and local repository:
	git add Test.txt; git commit -m"MC1"

-after that we add some more line in same file:
	 vim Test.txt => oprn file

-type ins=>to open insert windo

-to control + c
	to remove insert mode.

-after that 
	:wq! =>to back to git bash window fron linux 

-to check content of file
	cat Test.txt

-to commit newly added line:
	git add Test.txt; git commit -m"MC2"

-to se how many commit in master branch:
	git log --oneline

-To create feature branch
	git branch feature

-To switch feature branch
	git checkout feature

-To see file in feature branch:
	git ls-files
	inherit from master branch.

-To see how many commit in feature branch which is inherited from the mastre branch:
	git log --oneline

-To update the file whcihe is inherited from the master branch means test.txt file will modified.
	 vim test.txt

-add some line of code:
	this is a thared line of code addeed from feature branch.

-type ins=>insert mode will be on
	add some line of code

-type control + c to stope insert mode.

-type :wq!=>switch git bash window

-To see code is added or not:
	cat test.txt.

-To add this file to staging or local repo and commit this file
	git add test.txt; git commit -m"FC1"

-To see how much commits in feature branch:
	git log --oneline

-To switch again master branch:
	git checkout master

-To add new line in Test.txt in master branch
	vim text.txt
	 
	type-ins =>insert on

-To add some new code line

-To back to git bash => :wq!

-To add this new commit in staging or local repo:
	git add test.txt; git commit -m"MC2"

-to check the commint:
	git log --oneline

*We want to merge featcure branch into master branch lets see:
	git merge feature

Output:
Auto-merging test.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in test.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

*How we resolve the conflict:

-after run merging command :
-check content of file using :
	cat test.txt

CONTENT:
This is a first line code
This is a second line code
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a thared line code

=======
This is a thared line of code update from the feature branch
>>>>>>> feature

open file:
	vim test.txt

Clearly see file content is conflict:
This is a first line code
This is a second line code
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a thared line code

=======
This is a thared line of code update from the feature branch
>>>>>>> feature

As a Developer:

1: we want to have both lines.
	developer delete unwanted lines.

In linux comman:
	goto that line and press dd(delete line)

after that:
	:wq!

now see content of file:
	cat test.txt.
	we have four line

after resolving conflict after resolving conflict code to be added to staging and master branch:
	git add test.txt; git commit -m"merge commit from the git"

-to see how many commit are there in master branch:
	git log --oneline

Output :
2456c9e (HEAD -> master) merge commit
4a54704 MC2
b49c73a (feature) FC1
06494bb MC2
4270dff MC1

we want to see graphical view :
	git log --oneline --graph

graphical view:
*   2456c9e (HEAD -> master) merge commit
|\
| * b49c73a (feature) FC1
* | 4a54704 MC2
|/
* 06494bb MC2
* 4270dff MC1

NOTE:
-after upadating and to removing conflict from the master and feature branch  we merge them to master.
-so we want to cleaner and well manage code file we deleten the feature branch.

-to remove feature branch :
	git branch -d feature

-to check branch is delete or not:
	git branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git rebase command :

To create new projects:

Open git bash inside that project:

Initilize git inside that project:
	git init

to create some file inside that project
	touch a.txt b.txt

-to add them to staging a snd commit fro the maqster branch:
	git add a.txt; git commit -m"C1M"
	git add b.txt; git commit -m"C2M"

-to see commit:
	git log --oneline

create a feature branch:
	git branch feature

switch that branch:
	git checkout feature

how many branch we have:
	git branch

create some file in feature branch:
	touch x.txt y.txt


add and commit that feature branch:
	git add x.txt; git commit -m"C1F"
	git add y.txt; git commit -m"C2F"

to see all commits:
	git log --oneline

switch master branch
	git checkout master

create one more file in master
	touch c.txt

add to staging ans local repo:
	git add c.txt; git commit -m"C3M"

to check how much commit in master branch:
	git log --oneline
	git log --oneline master

to check how many commit in feature branch:
	git log --oneline feature

****Rebase command start here:
steps first:To reabes the feature branch on top of the master branch.(add feature branch on top of matsre branch but commit ID will be changed)
	git rebase feature

-currentlu we on master branch and we have some commit before rebase:we have three commit.
	fe9f93d (HEAD -> master) C3M
	0653039 C2M
	d9ba0bc C1M


In the feature branch we have four commit:
	b150b5e (feature) C2F
	4ee7d2e C1F
	0653039 C2M
	d9ba0bc C1M

to check branch:
	git checkout feature

-after rebase lets see what are the commit are there:
	git log --oneline master
	still three commit are there:
	fe9f93d (master) C3M
	0653039 C2M
	d9ba0bc C1M

Go to rebase :
	git rebase master
	$ git rebase master
	Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/feature.

-after reabse check feature branch commit:
	here is to checnge commit ID to compair before rebase commit ID for feature branch 	and to compair after rebase commit ID for feature branch. Id will be chenged. and 	header also checnged.

	git log --oneline feature
	fe1767e (HEAD -> feature) C2F
	ba3fb86 C1F
	fe9f93d (master) C3M
	0653039 C2M
	d9ba0bc C1M

switch to master branch
	git checkout master

Steps 2: To merge thode commit to master
	git merge feature
	-using fast forward merge.
Output:after rebase we merge thos in master branch
here no create conflict created.
Updating fe9f93d..fe1767e
Fast-forward
 x.txt | 0
 y.txt | 0
 2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 x.txt
 create mode 100644 y.txt

to check commit in master branch :
	git log --oneline master
	          Or
	git log --oneline --graph

Output:
* fe1767e (HEAD -> master, feature) C2F
* ba3fb86 C1F
* fe9f93d C3M
* 0653039 C2M
* d9ba0bc C1M

Here chenge HEAD nas Feature commit after merge.
* representing the current or master branch.
-without having any conflict without having any three way merge without creating a sepreat commit we can directly use rebase command.
-rebase command only work on a local machin becase developer and tester will working on your feature ans your master branch only.
-but when we working on a remote repository thete are multiple peopel working on multiple branches and there will folows only merging concepts.
-this is a alternative of the merge commit.

***Diffrence between gir push and git pull?

Here’s a detailed explanation of the git push and git pull commands, including their functionality, usage, and scenarios where each is applicable:

git push

Definition:
git push is a command used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. It transfers commits from your local branch to a specified branch on a remote repository.

How It Works:

When you run git push, Git looks for the specified remote repository and branch (e.g., origin/main).
If the remote branch does not have any new commits that your local branch doesn't have, Git will successfully upload your local commits.
If there are new commits in the remote branch that you don’t have in your local branch, Git will reject the push to prevent overwriting those changes. You will need to pull the changes first, resolve any conflicts, and then push again.
Usage:

Command Syntax:
git push <remote> <branch>

Example:
git push origin main

This command pushes the changes from your local main branch to the main branch on the remote repository named origin.
Common Scenarios:

Sharing work with team members.
Deploying code to a production server.
Backing up local changes to a remote repository.
Considerations:

Always ensure your local branch is up-to-date with the remote before pushing.
Use descriptive commit messages to maintain clarity in the project history.

git pull

Definition:
git pull is a command used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into your local branch. It is essentially a combination of git fetch (which retrieves changes) and git merge (which merges the changes into your current branch).

How It Works:

When you run git pull, Git first fetches changes from the specified remote branch.
It then merges those changes into your current branch.
If there are no conflicting changes, the merge is automatic.
If there are conflicts, Git will pause the merge and ask you to resolve them manually.
Usage:

Command Syntax:
git pull <remote> <branch>

Example:
git pull origin main

This command fetches the latest changes from the main branch of the remote repository named origin and merges them into your current branch.

Common Scenarios:

Keeping your local branch up-to-date with the latest changes from your team.
Syncing your work before starting new features or making significant changes.
Considerations:

Regularly pulling changes helps minimize merge conflicts.
If you frequently experience conflicts, consider using feature branches for new developments.

Key Differences

Direction:

git push: Moves changes from your local repository to a remote repository.

git pull: Moves changes from a remote repository to your local repository.

Action:

git push: Updates the remote repository with your commits.

git pull: Fetches changes from the remote and merges them into your local branch.

Conflict Handling:

git push: If the remote branch has new commits, the push will be rejected until you pull and resolve any conflicts.

git pull: May require conflict resolution if changes from the remote branch clash with your local changes.
Frequency of Use:

git push: Used less frequently, typically after completing a set of changes.

git pull: Used more frequently to stay updated with team changes.
Impact on History:

git push: Modifies the remote history by adding your commits.

git pull: Can alter your local history by merging incoming changes, especially if there are multiple contributors.

Conclusion
Understanding the differences and appropriate usage of git push and git pull is essential for effective collaboration in a Git-based workflow. Regularly using these commands ensures your work is integrated smoothly and helps maintain a clean and coherent project history.
